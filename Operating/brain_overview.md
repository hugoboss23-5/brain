# Brain Overview

Brain is a filesystem-based development environment where AI agents work with code and tasks.

## Structure
- **Operating/**: Working directory for active operations
- **Candidates/**: Proposed code or protocols under evaluation
- **Tests/**: Test files and harnesses
- **Logs/**: Action logs and reports
- **Origins/**: Reference materials (read-only)
- **system/**: Core infrastructure and agent runners

## Purpose
Brain provides a structured workspace where AI agents can:
- Read and analyze existing code
- Create and modify files within designated areas
- Execute tasks through a JSON-based operation system
- Log their actions for transparency

## Key Principle
All modifications happen through explicit JSON operations, ensuring controlled and traceable changes to the codebase.
